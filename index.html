            Roopesh Pathalil was born into a hardworking farming family in Kerala, as the second child of Ravindran, a dedicated farmer, and Shyamala, a homemaker. Growing up in a modest, middle-class family, Roopesh learned early on the values of hard work, responsibility, and resilience.
            <br><br>
            He pursued his primary education in a government school, followed by Plus Two in Science, before completing a Diploma in E & C Engineering from Nityananda Polytechnic, Kanhangad. However, his life was marked by personal hardships, the most significant being his mother’s battle with liver cirrhosis. Her prolonged illness and eventual passing deeply impacted Roopesh, shaping his outlook on life and his future ambitions.

                <p class="abt4">
                  In his early twenties, Roopesh faced one of the toughest times of his life. His mother, Shyamala, the family's pillar, was suffering from liver cirrhosis. Her illness weighed heavily on their household, and every day was a struggle to ensure her comfort.

                  One night, as Roopesh cared for her, the power suddenly went out. Given Shyamala's fragile health, this was more than an inconvenience—it sparked deep anxiety. The darkness that enveloped their home mirrored Roopesh's fear and helplessness as he tried to determine the cause of the power failure.

                He contacted every electrician he could think of, hoping that someone would come to their aid. But it was late, and no one was available to help. The night stretched on, filled with worry and sleeplessness. His mother’s condition added to the gravity of the situation, making the hours seem even longer.
                
                The next day, an electrician arrived and quickly identified a tripped RCCB as the issue. He bypassed it to restore power, compromising the home's safety with a temporary fix. Days later, a family member received an electric shock, highlighting the risks of neglecting safety for convenience.This incident deeply affected Roopesh. He couldn't forget that night—the fear, helplessness, and realization of their jeopardized safety. He vowed that no one should endure what his family experienced, facing darkness and danger alone in critical situations.
                <br>
                This experience planted the seed for what would eventually become the Rapid Action Team (RAT). Roopesh envisioned a service that would be there for people in their most vulnerable moments, offering not just technical solutions but also the reassurance of safety and care. RAT would be more than just a business; it would be a social commitment to protect and serve the community.
