            Roopesh Pathalil was born into a hardworking farming family in Kerala, as the second child of Ravindran, a dedicated farmer, and Shyamala, a homemaker. Growing up in a modest, middle-class family, Roopesh learned early on the values of hard work, responsibility, and resilience.
            <br><br>
            He pursued his primary education in a government school, followed by Plus Two in Science, before completing a Diploma in E & C Engineering from Nityananda Polytechnic, Kanhangad. However, his life was marked by personal hardships, the most significant being his mother’s battle with liver cirrhosis. Her prolonged illness and eventual passing deeply impacted Roopesh, shaping his outlook on life and his future ambitions.

                <p class="quicksand abt4">
                  In the prime of his youth, between the ages of 20 and 22, Roopesh faced one of the most challenging times of his life. His mother, Shyamala, the pillar of his family, was suffering from liver cirrhosis. The weight of her illness hung heavily on their household, and every day was a struggle to ensure her comfort and care.

One fateful night, as Roopesh tended to his mother, the power in their home suddenly went out. With Shyamala’s fragile health, this was more than just an inconvenience—it was a source of deep anxiety. The darkness that enveloped their home mirrored the fear and helplessness Roopesh felt as he tried to figure out the cause of the power failure.


Roopesh contacted every electrician he could think of, but no one was available that late at night. As worry and sleeplessness consumed him, his mother’s condition made the hours feel even longer.

The next day, an electrician arrived and identified the problem as a tripped RCCB. However, he bypassed it, restoring power but compromising safety. This temporary fix led to a family member receiving an electric shock days later, highlighting the dangers of neglecting safety for convenience.

The incident left a deep mark on Roopesh. The fear and helplessness of that night, along with the risk to his family’s safety, stayed with him. He vowed that no one should face such danger and isolation, especially in critical moments.
This experience planted the seed for what would eventually become the Rapid Action Team (RAT). Roopesh envisioned a service that would be there for people in their most vulnerable moments, offering not just technical solutions but also the reassurance of safety and care. RAT would be more than just a business; it would be a social commitment to protect and serve the community.

He was initiated as Param Sri Maha Chandala Dasananda Adimargi, symbolizing his dedication to both spirituality and service to society.
