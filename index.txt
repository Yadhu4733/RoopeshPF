Roopesh Pathalil: From Humble Beginnings to Visionary Leadership

Roopesh Pathalil was born into a hardworking farming family in Kerala, as the second child of Ravindran, a dedicated farmer, and Shyamala, a homemaker. Growing up in a modest, middle-class family, Roopesh learned early on the values of hard work, responsibility, and resilience.

He pursued his primary education in a government school, followed by Plus Two in Science, before completing a Diploma in E & C Engineering from Nityananda Polytechnic, Kanhangad. However, his life was marked by personal hardships, the most significant being his mother’s battle with liver cirrhosis. Her prolonged illness and eventual passing deeply impacted Roopesh, shaping his outlook on life and his future ambitions.

# A Life-Changing Incident
  
In the prime of his youth, between the ages of 20 and 22, Roopesh faced one of the most challenging times of his life. His mother, Shyamala, the pillar of his family, was suffering from liver cirrhosis. The weight of her illness hung heavily on their household, and every day was a struggle to ensure her comfort and care.

One fateful night, as Roopesh tended to his mother, the power in their home suddenly went out. With Shyamala’s fragile health, this was more than just an inconvenience—it was a source of deep anxiety. The darkness that enveloped their home mirrored the fear and helplessness Roopesh felt as he tried to figure out the cause of the power failure.

He contacted every electrician he could think of, hoping that someone would come to their aid. But it was late, and no one was available to help. The night stretched on, filled with worry and sleeplessness. His mother’s condition added to the gravity of the situation, making the hours seem even longer.

The following day, an electrician finally arrived. He quickly identified the problem as a tripped RCCB but chose to bypass it, restoring power but compromising the safety of the home. It was a temporary fix that avoided the real issue. A few days later, a family member received an electric shock, a stark reminder of the dangers of neglecting safety for convenience.

This incident had a profound impact on Roopesh. He couldn’t shake the memory of that night—the fear, the helplessness, and the realization that their safety had been jeopardized. It was then that he made a vow: no one should ever have to go through what his family did. No one should have to face the darkness and danger alone, especially in critical situations.

This experience planted the seed for what would eventually become the Rapid Action Team (RAT). Roopesh envisioned a service that would be there for people in their most vulnerable moments, offering not just technical solutions but also the reassurance of safety and care. RAT would be more than just a business; it would be a social commitment to protect and serve the community.

# Building a Technical Career
  
After his mother’s passing and this life-changing incident, Roopesh focused on building his technical skills. In 2013, he joined Amrita College of Engineering as a driver and electrician, progressing to roles as a supervisor and electrical engineer. He later worked as a solar installation engineer, further diversifying his technical expertise.

A key influence during this time was Br. Muralidharan, the Head of the Electrical Department at the college, who became Roopesh’s mentor. Muralidharan not only taught him about electrical engineering but also instilled in him the importance of helping others in times of need.

# Spiritual Awakening 
  
Roopesh’s life was not only shaped by technical and professional growth but also by a profound spiritual journey. Seeking a deeper understanding of life, he spent a year under Adimagi maha chandala Baba Malawari Muthan, undergoing gurukula education and studying the Tantrik Malavaram and Vaidik systems. He was initiated as Param Sri Maha Chandala Dasananda Adimargi, a spiritual name symbolizing his commitment to serving both society and spirituality.

This experience gave Roopesh a clear vision of life and society, reaffirming his desire to contribute positively to the world around him.

# The Birth of Rapid Action Team (RAT)
  
With a clear purpose in mind and driven by the lessons learned from his personal experiences, Roopesh founded Rapid Action Team (RAT) in Kochi, a 24-hour maintenance service company designed to provide prompt and reliable electrical support to homes and businesses. 

RAT was born from Roopesh’s burning desire to ensure that no one would ever have to experience what his family did that night. He was committed to creating a service that prioritized safety, reliability, and fast action, so families wouldn’t have to suffer in the face of electrical emergencies. RAT became more than a business—it was a mission to serve the community and ensure the well-being of its members.

# Expanding His Vision
  
Building on the success of RAT, Roopesh expanded his entrepreneurial efforts by founding Aigerpeak LLP, a company offering premium electrical and plumbing services, particularly for larger-scale projects. Aigerpeak LLP provides the same high standards of service that RAT was built on, ensuring quality and dependability in all its projects.

# Culinary Ventures
  
Roopesh’s entrepreneurial spirit wasn’t limited to the electrical field. He also ventured into the culinary space by partnering to create Chef Sandhya’s Kitchen, a cloud kitchen that serves delicious and healthy local food. This venture allowed Roopesh to diversify his portfolio while staying true to his core values of quality and service.

# A Life Dedicated to Service
  
Today, Roopesh Pathalil leads multiple successful businesses, each built on the principles of trust, quality, and a deep commitment to serving others. His burning desire to make electrical services accessible, reliable, and safe for everyone continues to drive his work. Through Rapid Action Team, Aigerpeak LLP, and Chef Sandhya’s Kitchen, Roopesh ensures that his businesses improve lives and bring safety, comfort, and satisfaction to his clients.

From a farming family in Kerala to becoming a successful entrepreneur and social leader, Roopesh’s story is one of perseverance, resilience, and an unwavering dedication to serving the needs of his community.
